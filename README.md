 I've successfully implemented a complete MVC architecture using Spring Boot! ðŸŒŸ 
 
 This project encompasses a range of key concepts and best practices, ensuring a robust and scalable web application. 
 
 Here's a quick overview of what it includes:

1. The Presentation Layer: DTO and Controllers
2. The Persistence Layer: JPA Repository
3. The Service Layer: Writing Business Logic
4. PUT, PATCH, and DELETE Mappings in Spring Web MVC
5. Input Validation Annotations and Custom Annotations for Validation
6. Exception Handling in Spring Boot Web MVC
7. Transforming API Responses in Spring Web MVC
   
This project has been a fantastic journey, helping me deepen my understanding of Spring Boot and the MVC pattern.

ðŸ’¡I'm excited to continue building on this foundation and exploring new technologies.
